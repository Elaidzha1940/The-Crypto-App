# The-Crypto-App
Build SwiftUI Crypto Tracker App with MVVM, Core Data, Combine, and API requests.

For the last month I was busy with Crypto Tracker App. 
Finally it’s done ✔️ 
I’m really happy to share it here. 

Well, a bit about tech and what I’ve done with: 
- Swift and SwiftUI 
- MVVM 
- Model based on JSON & Market Statistics from API
- Core Data, FileManager, 
- Search Bar - Custom and Reusable 
- Filtering with Combine 
- Multi-threading with background 
- Sorting List 
- Custom NavigationLink for Lazy loading 
- Grid - Updating
- Custom Line Chart
- Expendable collapsable description
